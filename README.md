### Project Description

A fun and addictive little web app that simulates popping bubble wrap ‚Äî complete with popping sound, satisfying visuals, and a score/achievement system. Built purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a simple, lightweight experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

We all need stress relief ‚Äî but real bubble wrap runs out and is noisy in public. Who says happiness shouldn‚Äôt be unlimited and mess-free?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

A browser-based bubble wrap simulator: infinite bubbles, perfect pops, shareable high scores, and the sweet satisfaction of popping without any waste.

### How It Works

1. The UI renders a responsive grid of interactive bubble elements.
2. When a user clicks/taps a bubble, it plays a pop sound and triggers a pop animation.
3. Score increments; achievements unlock at milestones.
